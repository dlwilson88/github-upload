systemd.resource-control \- Resource control unit settings
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fIslice\fR\&.slice,
\fIscope\fR\&.scope,
\fIservice\fR\&.service,
\fIsocket\fR\&.socket,
\fImount\fR\&.mount,
\fIswap\fR\&.swap
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Unit configuration files for services, slices, scopes, sockets, mount points, and swap devices share a subset of configuration options for resource control of spawned processes\&. Internally, this relies on the Linux Control Groups (cgroups) kernel concept for organizing processes in a hierarchical tree of named groups for the purpose of resource management\&.
.PP
This man page lists the configuration options shared by those six unit types\&. See
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
\fBsystemd.slice\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.scope\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5), and
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5)
for more information on the specific unit configuration files\&. The resource control configuration options are configured in the [Slice], [Scope], [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap] sections, depending on the unit type\&.
.PP
In addition, options which control resources available to programs
\fIexecuted\fR
by systemd are listed in
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)\&. Those options complement options listed here\&.
.PP
See the
\m[blue]\fBNew Control Group Interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
for an introduction on how to make use of resource control APIs from programs\&.
.SH "IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES"
.PP
The following dependencies are implicitly added:
.sp

.\}
.el \{\

Units with the
\fISlice=\fR
setting set automatically acquire
\fIRequires=\fR
and
\fIAfter=\fR
dependencies on the specified slice unit\&.
.RE
.SH "UNIFIED AND LEGACY CONTROL GROUP HIERARCHIES"
.PP
The unified control group hierarchy is the new version of kernel control group interface, see
\m[blue]\fBcgroup\-v2\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. Depending on the resource type, there are differences in resource control capabilities\&. Also, because of interface changes, some resource types have separate set of options on the unified hierarchy\&.
.PP
.PP
\fBCPU\fR
.RS 4
\fICPUWeight=\fR
and
\fIStartupCPUWeight=\fR
replace
\fICPUShares=\fR
and
\fIStartupCPUShares=\fR, respectively\&.
.sp
The
"cpuacct"
controller does not exist separately on the unified hierarchy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMemory\fR
.RS 4
\fIMemoryMax=\fR
replaces
\fIMemoryLimit=\fR\&.
\fIMemoryLow=\fR
and
\fIMemoryHigh=\fR
are effective only on unified hierarchy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBIO\fR
.RS 4
\fIIO\fR
prefixed settings are a superset of and replace
\fIBlockIO\fR
prefixed ones\&. On unified hierarchy, IO resource control also applies to buffered writes\&.
.RE
.PP
To ease the transition, there is best\-effort translation between the two versions of settings\&. For each controller, if any of the settings for the unified hierarchy are present, all settings for the legacy hierarchy are ignored\&. If the resulting settings are for the other type of hierarchy, the configurations are translated before application\&.
.PP
Legacy control group hierarchy (see
\m[blue]\fBcgroups\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2), also called cgroup\-v1, doesn\*(Aqt allow safe delegation of controllers to unprivileged processes\&. If the system uses the legacy control group hierarchy, resource control is disabled for systemd user instance, see
\fBsystemd\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Units of the types listed above can have settings for resource control configuration:
.PP
\fICPUAccounting=\fR
.RS 4
Turn on CPU usage accounting for this unit\&. Takes a boolean argument\&. Note that turning on CPU accounting for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units contained in the same slice and for all its parent slices and the units contained therein\&. The system default for this setting may be controlled with
\fIDefaultCPUAccounting=\fR
in
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUWeight=\fR\fI\fIweight\fR\fR, \fIStartupCPUWeight=\fR\fI\fIweight\fR\fR
.RS 4
Assign the specified CPU time weight to the processes executed, if the unified control group hierarchy is used on the system\&. These options take an integer value and control the
"cpu\&.weight"
control group attribute\&. The allowed range is 1 to 10000\&. Defaults to 100\&. For details about this control group attribute, see
\m[blue]\fBcgroup\-v2\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
and
\m[blue]\fBsched\-design\-CFS\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&. The available CPU time is split up among all units within one slice relative to their CPU time weight\&.
.sp
While
\fIStartupCPUWeight=\fR
only applies to the startup phase of the system,
\fICPUWeight=\fR
applies to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup phase\&. Using
\fIStartupCPUWeight=\fR
allows prioritizing specific services at boot\-up differently than during normal runtime\&.
.sp
These settings replace
\fICPUShares=\fR
and
\fIStartupCPUShares=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUQuota=\fR
.RS 4
Assign the specified CPU time quota to the processes executed\&. Takes a percentage value, suffixed with "%"\&. The percentage specifies how much CPU time the unit shall get at maximum, relative to the total CPU time available on one CPU\&. Use values > 100% for allotting CPU time on more than one CPU\&. This controls the
"cpu\&.max"
attribute on the unified control group hierarchy and
"cpu\&.cfs_quota_us"
on legacy\&. For details about these control group attributes, see
\m[blue]\fBcgroup\-v2\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
and
\m[blue]\fBsched\-bwc\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
Example:
\fICPUQuota=20%\fR
ensures that the executed processes will never get more than 20% CPU time on one CPU\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUQuotaPeriodSec=\fR
.RS 4
Assign the duration over which the CPU time quota specified by
\fICPUQuota=\fR
is measured\&. Takes a time duration value in seconds, with an optional suffix such as "ms" for milliseconds (or "s" for seconds\&.) The default setting is 100ms\&. The period is clamped to the range supported by the kernel, which is [1ms, 1000ms]\&. Additionally, the period is adjusted up so that the quota interval is also at least 1ms\&. Setting
\fICPUQuotaPeriodSec=\fR
to an empty value resets it to the default\&.
.sp
This controls the second field of
"cpu\&.max"
attribute on the unified control group hierarchy and
"cpu\&.cfs_period_us"
on legacy\&. For details about these control group attributes, see
\m[blue]\fBcgroup\-v2\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
and
\m[blue]\fBsched\-design\-CFS\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&.

Example:
\fICPUQuotaPeriodSec=10ms\fR
to request that the CPU quota is measured in periods of 10ms\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMemoryAccounting=\fR
.RS 4
Turn on process and kernel memory accounting for this unit\&. Takes a boolean argument\&. Note that turning on memory accounting for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units contained in the same slice and for all its parent slices and the units contained therein\&. The system default for this setting may be controlled with
\fIDefaultMemoryAccounting=\fR

.PP
\fIMemoryMin=\fR\fI\fIbytes\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the memory usage protection of the executed processes in this unit\&. If the memory usages of this unit and all its ancestors are below their minimum boundaries, this unit\*(Aqs memory won\*(Aqt be reclaimed\&.
.sp
Takes a memory size in bytes\&. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively\&. Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical memory on the system\&. This controls the
"memory\&.min"
control group attribute\&. For details about this control group attribute, see
\m[blue]\fBcgroup\-v2\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.

\fIMemoryLimit=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMemoryHigh=\fR\fI\fIbytes\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the high limit on memory usage of the executed processes in this unit\&. Memory usage may go above the limit if unavoidable, but the processes are heavily slowed down and memory is taken away aggressively in such cases\&. This is the main mechanism to control memory usage of a unit\&.
.sp
Takes a memory size in bytes\&. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively\&. Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical memory on the system\&. If assigned the special value
"infinity", no memory limit is applied\&. This controls the
"memory\&.high"
control group attribute\&. For details about this control group attribute, see
\m[blue]\fBcgroup\-v2\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.

\fIMemoryHigh=\fR
as the main control mechanism and use
\fIMemoryMax=\fR
as the last line of defense\&.

Specify the absolute limit on swap usage of the executed processes in this unit\&.
.sp
Takes a swap size in bytes\&. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified swap size is parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively\&. If assigned the special value
"infinity", no swap limit is applied\&. This controls the

.RE
.PP
\fITasksAccounting=\fR
.RS 4
Turn on task accounting for this unit\&. Takes a boolean argument\&. If enabled, the system manager will keep track of the number of tasks in the unit\&. The number of tasks accounted this way includes both kernel threads and userspace processes, with each thread counting individually\&. Note that turning on tasks accounting for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units contained in the same slice and for all its parent slices and the units contained therein\&. The system default for this setting may be controlled with
\fIDefaultTasksAccounting=\fR
in
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fITasksMax=\fR\fI\fIN\fR\fR

In order to implement a whitelisting IP firewall, it is recommended to use a

setting on an upper\-level slice unit (such as the root slice
\-\&.slice

\fIIPAddressAllow=\fR
lines permitting network access to relevant services, and only them\&.
.sp
Note that for socket\-activated services, the IP access list configured on the socket unit applies to all sockets associated with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the ultimately activated services for it\&. Conversely, the IP access list configured for the service is not applied to any sockets passed into the service via socket activation\&. Thus, it is usually a good idea, to replicate the IP access lists on both the socket and the service unit, however it often makes sense to maintain one list more open and the other one more restricted, depending on the usecase\&.

\fIw\fRriting, or creation of the specific device node(s) by the unit (\fIm\fRknod), respectively\&. This controls the

The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with
/dev/, or a string starting with either
"char\-"
or
"block\-"
followed by a device group name, as listed in
/proc/devices\&. The latter is useful to whitelist all current and future devices belonging to a specific device group at once\&. The device group is matched according to filename globbing rules, you may hence use the
"*"
and
"?"
wildcards\&. Examples:
/dev/sda5
is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or SCSI block device\&.
"char\-pts"
and
"char\-alsa"
are specifiers for all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively\&.
"char\-cpu/*"
is a specifier matching all CPU related device groups\&.

\fISlice=\fR
.RS 4
The name of the slice unit to place the unit in\&. Defaults to
system\&.slice
for all non\-instantiated units of all unit types (except for slice units themselves see below)\&. Instance units are by default placed in a subslice of
system\&.slice
that is named after the template name\&.
.sp
This option may be used to arrange systemd units in a hierarchy of slices each of which might have resource settings applied\&.
.sp
For units of type slice, the only accepted value for this setting is the parent slice\&. Since the name of a slice unit implies the parent slice, it is hence redundant to ever set this parameter directly for slice units\&.
.sp
Special care should be taken when relying on the default slice assignment in templated service units that have
\fIDefaultDependencies=no\fR
set, see
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5), section "Default Dependencies" for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDelegate=\fR
.RS 4
Turns on delegation of further resource control partitioning to processes of the unit\&. Units where this is enabled may create and manage their own private subhierarchy of control groups below the control group of the unit itself\&. For unprivileged services (i\&.e\&. those using the
\fIUser=\fR
setting) the unit\*(Aqs control group will be made accessible to the relevant user\&. When enabled the service manager will refrain from manipulating control groups or moving processes below the unit\*(Aqs control group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the control group tree above the unit\*(Aqs control group (i\&.e\&. towards the root control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group tree below the unit\*(Aqs control group is owned and managed by the unit itself\&. Takes either a boolean argument or a list of control group controller names\&. If true, delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are enabled for the unit, making them available to the unit\*(Aqs processes for management\&. If false, delegation is turned off entirely (and no additional controllers are enabled)\&. If set to a list of controllers, delegation is turned on, and the specified controllers are enabled for the unit\&. Note that additional controllers than the ones specified might be made available as well, depending on configuration of the containing slice unit or other units contained in it\&. Note that assigning the empty string will enable delegation, but reset the list of controllers, all assignments prior to this will have no effect\&. Defaults to false\&.
.sp
Note that controller delegation to less privileged code is only safe on the unified control group hierarchy\&. Accordingly, access to the specified controllers will not be granted to unprivileged services on the legacy hierarchy, even when requested\&.
.sp
The following controller names may be specified:
\fBcpu\fR,
\fBcpuacct\fR,
\fBio\fR,
\fBblkio\fR,
\fBmemory\fR,
\fBdevices\fR,
\fBpids\fR\&. Not all of these controllers are available on all kernels however, and some are specific to the unified hierarchy while others are specific to the legacy hierarchy\&. Also note that the kernel might support further controllers, which aren\*(Aqt covered here yet as delegation is either not supported at all for them or not defined cleanly\&.
.sp
For further details on the delegation model consult
\m[blue]\fBControl Group APIs and Delegation\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[8]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDisableControllers=\fR
.RS 4
Disables controllers from being enabled for a unit\*(Aqs children\&. If a controller listed is already in use in its subtree, the controller will be removed from the subtree\&. This can be used to avoid child units being able to implicitly or explicitly enable a controller\&. Defaults to not disabling any controllers\&.
.sp
It may not be possible to successfully disable a controller if the unit or any child of the unit in question delegates controllers to its children, as any delegated subtree of the cgroup hierarchy is unmanaged by systemd\&.
.sp
Multiple controllers may be specified, separated by spaces\&. You may also pass
\fIDisableControllers=\fR
multiple times, in which case each new instance adds another controller to disable\&. Passing
\fIDisableControllers=\fR
by itself with no controller name present resets the disabled controller list\&.
.sp
Valid controllers are
\fBcpu\fR,
\fBcpuacct\fR,
\fBio\fR,
\fBblkio\fR,
\fBmemory\fR,
\fBdevices\fR, and
\fBpids\fR\&.
