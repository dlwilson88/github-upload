About
I love man pages, however they are annoying to write by hand, and often converted from markdown anyway. mad(1) is effectively the same idea, but write your manuals in markdown like you would anyway, re-use them in your github readmes, wikis, or use markdown to HTML conversion tools.

mad(1) pipes to less(1) so you get the same paging / searching goodness that you expect from man(1).

Page repository
mad-pages is a collection of useful mad pages such as language operator precedence tables, http status codes, mime type tables etc. Use mad --update to install/re-install them.

Page lookup
Use the MAD_PATH environment variable to control where mad(1) will look for a manual page. The ".md" extension may be omitted.

For example:

MAD_PATH="/usr/share/mad:share/mad"
The following paths will always be searched:

 - .
 - /usr/local/share/mad
 - /usr/share/mad
 
Configuration
By default mad(1) installs and sources /usr/local/etc/mad.conf for its formatting. You may edit this file directly, or if you're scared of overwriting it when updating mad(1) you can copy this file to something like ~/mad.conf and export MAD_CONFIG=~/mad.conf.
